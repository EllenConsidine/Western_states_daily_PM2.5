# download-earth-observations
Download scripts to facilitate in downloading and processing various data sets needed for this project.

This folder contains the following scripts:
* **MODIS_FTP_download.py**: This script takes in an available data set on the NASA FTP download site and downloads all data from 2008-2014.

    UPDATE: Recieved this email from NASA LAADS, making script obsolete because FTP site no longer exists. Script will need
    to be refactored to use HTTPS retrievals instead.
    
    "Due to new NASA Policies LAADS FTP servers (both public and private) will be shutting down around Monday, April 20th 2018. 
    Please convert all scripts and other methods of access to using HTTPS. Instructions for accessing data via HTTPS can 
    be found at https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/tools-and-services/data-download-scripts"

* **NED_bulk_download.py**: This script takes in a csv with NED download URLs and downloads them one by one to a desired location locally.

* **NED_bulk_download_list.csv**: This .csv file is the file that contains the download URL and other metadata for each file that needs to be downloaded for our study area. This .csv file was generated by accessing the NED download page, adding all orders to the cart, and selecting the option to "Export Items to CSV". 

* **modis_aod_create_csv_file.py**: This script converts the raw MODIS AOD .hdf files to corresponding .csv files

* **modis_aod_convert_csv_to_shapefile.py**: This script converts each .csv file to a corresponding .shp file


* **modis_aod_create_daily_averages.py** This script merges .shp files that occur on the same day into a single .shp file
