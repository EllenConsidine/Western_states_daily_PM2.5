\subsubsection*{Brief Description}

\subsubsection*{Notes}

Files Fire\_Cache\_Smoke\_DRI\_Smoke\_E-BAM\_231.csv and Fire\_Cache\_Smoke\_DRI\_Smoke\_E-BAM\_866.csv were deleted because it only had data across 3 days, but none of them met the basic requirements to be put into the final data (e.g., not enough observations or negative concentrations).

Fire\_Cache\_Smoke\_DRI\_Smoke\_E\_BAM\_65.csv was also deleted because it only had 5 data points across 2 days, and we are requiring at least 18 hourly data points within a day to be put into the final data.
