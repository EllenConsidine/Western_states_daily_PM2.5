\subsubsection*{Brief Description}

We will obtain meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) \citep{Mesinger2006,NCEPReanalysis2005} because it includes all of the standard meteorological variables but also has planetary boundary layer height, which has proved to be an important variable for converting AOD to PM\textsubscript{2.5} \citep{liu_estimating_2005}. We will calculate 24-hour averages from 3-hourly data for temperature, relative humidity, sea level pressure, surface pressure, planetary boundary layer height, dew point temperature, precipitation, and the U and V components of wind speed. NARR has 32 km resolution and is available from 1979 onward. 

\subsubsection*{Notes}

We contacted Chi-Fan Shih at NCAR. She emailed us a link to the requested data (link is only valid for 11 days). The data is 28.31 G, and the website provides a few options for how to download the data. We chose the ``Perl download script'' button, which generates a short perl script specific to the requested data. To use this, we downloaded Perl \url{http://strawberryperl.com/} (see also \url{https://www.perl.org/}). The generated perl script calls wget( \url{https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/})

The files came as yyyy.grb.tar where yyyy are years 2008-2014. To un-tar the files, open GitBash, and type: tar -xvf 2008.grb.tar

This will create a folder called 2008 with many .grb files. Repeat for the other years. See also \url{https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/~ethrane/Resources/UNIX/}
