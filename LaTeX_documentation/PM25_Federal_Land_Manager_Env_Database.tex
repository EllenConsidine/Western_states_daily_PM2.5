%UNCOMMENT \subsubsection*{Brief Description}

%UNCOMMENT We will download PM\textsubscript{2.5} data from both the US EPA AQS Air Data Query Tool \citep{EPAAirData2017} and the IMPROVE monitors that capture air quality information in 
%UNCOMMENT more rural areas \citep{EPANPM25IMPROVE2017} for the 11-state region (Figure \ref{fig:Map11States}) including any of the following parameter codes: 88101, 88500, 88502, 81104 \citep{EPANPM25Memo2017,EPANPM25Parameters2017,EPANAllParameters2017}. %In 2014, there were approximately 1600 PM\textsubscript{2.5} monitors (Figure \ref{fig:MapLocations}). For the 7-year study period, we anticipate approximately 1.4 million monitor-days. 

We downloaded IMPROVE PM\textsubscript{2.5} data from the Federal Land Manager Environmental Database maintained by CIRA and Colorado State University. The IMPROVE monitors capture air quality information in more rural areas \citep{EPANPM25IMPROVE2017}. We are including any of the following parameter codes: 88101, 88500, 88502, 81104 \citep{EPANPM25Memo2017,EPANPM25Parameters2017,EPANAllParameters2017}.

The data does not come with datum information. When processing the data, the datum is input as WGS84 per an email from Bret Schichtel on October 22, 2018.

%\noindent Downloading IMPROVE Aerosol, RHR III (DRAFT-Preliminary...) data: 
\noindent Downloading IMPROVE Aerosol, RHR II (New Equation) data (one parameter at at time):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reports: Raw data
\item Datasets:``IMPROVE Aerosol, RHR II (New Equation)''
\item Sites: select all
\item Parameters: 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Mass, PM2.5 (Fine): Code MF, Type PM2.5, Units ug/m\^3 LC AQS ID 88101
  \item Mass, PM2.5 Reconstructed (Fine): Code RCFM, Type PM2.5 Units ug/m\^3 LC, AQS ID 88401
  \end{enumerate}
\item Select Dates: By Years and Months: 2008-2014; select all months
\item Aggregations: Non-aggregated
\item Fields: Select All
\item When 2008-2014 data was downloaded: Options: Text File; Generate one file containing all the data; Comma delimited, Standard (``wide'' format); Data \& Metadata, Display Column Headers, Don't Display Section Titles, String Quotes: Double Quotes, Missing Values (blank); Date Format: 3/14/2002; Display Results: In a separate browser window; Show Report Log
\item When 2008-2017 data was downloaded: Options: Text File; Generate one file containing all the data; Comma delimited, Standard (``wide'' format); Data \& Metadata, %Display Column Headers, Don't Display Section Titles, 
String Quotes: Double Quotes, Missing Values (blank); Date Format: 3/14/2002; Display Results: In a separate browser window; %Show Report Log

\item Submit
\end{enumerate}

Repeat the downloading steps above, except replace step \#2 with these Datasets and parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item IMPROVE Aerosol, RHR III (DRAFT - Preliminary Most Impaired Days dataset) 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Mass, PM2.5 (Fine) is listed twice %for the 2008-2014 data these turned out to be the same data%, download one at a time - referred to as `first param' and `second param' in file names - these turned out to be the same data
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

After downloading data, save each file as *\_top\_removed.csv and remove all rows above the main section of data (approximately 270 rows).

%UNCOMMENT ``Hello Federal Land Manager Environmental Database,

%UNCOMMENT I have downloaded several files from http://views.cira.colostate.edu/fed/DataWizard/Default.aspx for my research. How can I determine which datum (e.g., WGS84, NAD83, etc.) is associated with the latitude and longitude data in those files?
