\subsubsection*{Brief Description}

We will collect data about fire detection locations, size, and fire radiative power from the Landsat-derived burned area essential climate variable (BAECV) fire activity data, 
\citep{MODISBurnArea}. 
Using GIS techniques, we will create daily clusters of fire points and use these to calculate: (1) the distance to the nearest fire cluster by day and (2) the sum of Fire Radiative Power (FRP) of the nearest clusters of fires by day as it is likely that smoke levels are higher closer to fires.  The BAECV can detect fires larger than 4 km\textsuperscript{2} and provides an estimate of the date of the fire and is available from 1984-2015.

\subsubsection*{Methods}
\begin{enumerate}
\item BAECV data set already downloaded by EarthLab fire group. Navigate to the `earthlab-ls-fire` S3 bucket, then the v1.1 subdirectory. Here you will find yearly .tar.gz files. Have not spent time decompressing files and exploring data yet but my guess is that within each yearly file, we will find more detailed, daily burn data.
