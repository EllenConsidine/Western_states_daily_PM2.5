\section{Compiling Data}

\subsection{Processing PM2.5 data}

These are the scripts that process and compile the PM2.5 data:
\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
\item Script1\_Install\_Pkgs.R >> install packages
\item Create\_ML\_Input\_File.R >> compiles the various PM2.5 data sources into a single data frame. The only eliminations of data are geographic, to remove states that are neither in our study area nor adjacent to it.
\item Clean\_ML\_Input\_File.R >> clean data, e.g., negative concentrations
\item [to be written] >> composite replicate data
\item Plot\_ML\_Input\_File.R >> create plots, maps, and statistical summary
\item [to be written] >> merge with satelite and other data
\end{enumerate}
