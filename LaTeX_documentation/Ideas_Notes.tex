\section{Ideas, To Do, Resources, etc}

Consider using the work of Westerling et al for a comprehensive fire history (up through 2012) \url{http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5789/940}, \url{http://www.pnas.org/content/108/32/13165}, \url{http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1696/20150178} \cite{westerling_increasing_2016,WesterlingCorrection2016} Also look into the fire histories referenced in Westerling \cite{westerling_increasing_2016,WesterlingCorrection2016}: \url{http://fam.nwcg.gov/fam-web/weatherfirecd/fire_files.htm} and \url{http://fam.nwcg.gov/fam-web/kcfast/mnmenu.htm} See also \url{http://www.nifc.gov}

Look at \cite{kollanus_effects_2016} again for references for PM2.5 paper, especially the introduction. Consider using NAAPS in our study. 

Idea: look at ambulance calls and PM2.5, similar to what \cite{salimi_ambient_2016} did in Australia.

US National Atlas \url{http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/atlasftp.html}

Thought: Using DigitalGlobe for fire data compared to NASA: would have higher spatial resolution, but not consistently viewing all areas (no cost to CU people) 
% Sentinal only goes back a couple of years
